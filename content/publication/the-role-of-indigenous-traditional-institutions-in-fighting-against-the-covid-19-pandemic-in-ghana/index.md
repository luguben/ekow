abstract: Indigenous traditional chieftaincy institutions in Ghana continue to
  gain recognition whilst wielding influence across socio-political divides. In
  this viewpoint essay, against the backdrop of the fight against the global
  COVID-19 pandemic, the author explores the potential roles of these
  institutions in fighting the pandemic. Particularly cognisant of their roles
  in Ghanaâ€™s transition from pre-colonial, colonial, and post-colonial, through
  independence to a democracy and its consolidation, this article argues that
  the existence of the chieftaincy institutions as change agents presents a
  wealth of opportunity to be harnessed for pandemic control, management, and
  containment.
