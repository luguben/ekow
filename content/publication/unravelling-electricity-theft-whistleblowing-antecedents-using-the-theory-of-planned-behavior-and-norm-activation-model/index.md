abstract: Electricity theft is a challenge for developing countries including
  Ghana. Given its detrimental impacts on utility companiesâ€™ fiscal outlook and
  investment attractiveness, countervailing measures have been instituted.
  However, these have yielded suboptimal outcomes and thus excited
  whistleblowing discourses. Therefore, the current study engages a behavior
  paradigm to probe individual electricity theft whistleblowing intention
  behavior. With 471 responses, the results from structural equation modelling
  affirmed a positive relationship between awareness of consequences and
  attitude. Also, a positive relationship between awareness of consequences and
  subjective norm was confirmed. Moreover, whereas the positive relationship
  between subjective norm and attitude was verified, the positive relationships
  between perceived behavior control and personal norm was established. Attitude
  was also certified to be positively related to whistleblowing intention. In
  addition, perceived behavior control and personal norm were confirmed to be
  positively related to intention. Ascription of consequences was also revealed
  to be significantly related to personal norm. Similarly, ascription of
  responsibility was confirmed to moderate the relationships between attitude
  and intention, and personal norm and intention. In addition to demonstrating
  the appropriateness, applicability and efficacy of the proposed model in
  predicting electricity theft whistleblowing intention, the study outcomes form
  grounds for instituting anti-theft policy interventions.
