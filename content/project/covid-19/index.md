Vincent is affiliated to the Centre for Policy Research Ghana. Over the past years, my research interests have significantly cut across a diverse reasonable spectrum of discourses ranging from social protection, social exclusion/inclusion, health and technology policy and studies with bearings on development sustainability studies. My research employs social science paradigms as a pathway to provide insights into, and further understanding of the intersection beteeen policies and development.
